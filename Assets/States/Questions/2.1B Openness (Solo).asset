  storyText: 'You log in to CANoE''s servers and begin your analysis. You have a
    couple of options here.

    You''ve been developing a new radical technique
    to trace the attack back to the source using frequency modulation inside the
    IP packet headers.

    Or should you start with the more methodical approach
    to follow the established checklist and first close the TCP ports being used
    by the attacker?


    What do you do?

    A: Bold but risky - trace the attack
    back

    B: Tried and true - run the checklist.'
