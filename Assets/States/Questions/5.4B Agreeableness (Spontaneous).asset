  storyText: 'As you send a message back, a conversation develops.

    They share
    the motive for the attack, and it almost sounds reasonable.

    Apparently your
    client has hidden some nefarious dealings and the hacker is trying to bring them
    to light.


    What do you do?

    A. Listen to the hacker''s story - help
    them uncover CANoE''s misdeeds.

    B. Do your job and stay loyal to OCE&N -
    the hacker isn''t reliable and you don''t care about their problems.'
