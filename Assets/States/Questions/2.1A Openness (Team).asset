  storyText: 'You get the team together in the conference room.

    Alec projects
    the state of CANoE''s servers onto the large display on the far wall.

    He
    wants to try a new radical technique he''s developed to trace the attack back
    to the source using frequency modulation inside the IP packet headers.

    Sophie
    advocates a more methodical approach to follow the established checklist and
    first close the TCP ports being used by the attacker.


    What do you do?

    A:
    Bold but risky - give Alec the go-ahead.

    B: Tried and true - have Sophie
    run the checklist.'
